A few weeks back on one Sunday\n                when I was at my daughters’ school; I very casually asked the faculty there\n                if there were any openings for a teacher who could be interested and I inquired\n                about the application and selection process. I was told that being a teacher\n                itself was difficult, but they did have space in their inclusion team for teachers\n                to be a learning support to individual children. They encouraged me to email the\n                person in charge immediately and that it was a great opportunity to be\n                a part of this school.\n              </p> <p class=\"text-justify dancing-font has-text-weight-semibold is-hidden-tablet-only p-b-10\">\n                “Everything depends on what is in our hearts.

On the other hand,\n                if we have the confidence that we can definitely do something, then we are already\n                one step closer to achieving it in reality.”\n              </p></div></div> <div class=\"is-hidden-desktop is-hidden-mobile-only p-l-15 p-r-15 p-t-10\"><p class=\"text-justify dancing-font has-text-weight-semibold\">\n              “Everything depends on what is in our hearts.

I didn’t want to\n              lose out on what seemed like a rainbow. I sent an email on Monday morning and\n              within the hour I got an email saying the job I was looking for was taken but\n              there was space for the same role but as a part time job and that my CV was going\n              to be forwarded there. As promised, the school called me the next day and the team\n              gave me a brief of the job and explained that there were 2 openings … for grade 1\n              and 5. Having worked only with younger children I did share my preference of working\n              with the child of grade1.\n            </p> <p class=\"text-justify dancing-font has-text-weight-semibold p-b-10\">\n              “Life is filled with potential that is truly unfathomable. At last, we are coming to\n              see the enormous power it possesses. That is why we must never write anyone off.\n              In particular, we mustn’t put boundaries on our own potential. In most cases, our\n              so-called limitations are nothing more than our own decision to limit ourselves”\n            </p> <p class=\"text-justify p-b-10\">\n              I am happy to share that though I was not sure about my own ability to\n              teach an older child grade 5 student, the school was convinced that it\n              was a better fit and that she saw the potential in me and knew I could do\n              it and they offered me the job for the grade 5 child.\n            </p> <p class=\"text-justify p-b-10\">\n              I was ecstatic, my happiness knew no bounds. I was doing an online teaching\n              course and needed to get a go ahead for taking up this part time job. My mentors\n              supported my decision and encouraged me to take up this opportunity without batting\n              an eyelid. I am now juggling a job, a course, an internship across various time zones.\n            </p> <p class=\"text-justify p-b-10\">\n              I determine to make causes and take actions that will determine my future.\n            </p> <p class=\"text-justify dancing-font has-text-weight-semibold p-b-10\">\n              “Activity is another name for happiness. Give free, unfettered play to your\n              unique talents, live with the full radiance of your being. This is what it means\n              to be truly alive.”\n            </p></div></div></div></div></div>")])}
