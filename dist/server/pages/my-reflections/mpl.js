Living\n              is the journey from not knowing to knowing. From not understanding-to-understanding.\n              From confusion to clarity. By universal design you are born into a perplexing situation,\n              bewildered and you have one job as a human: figure this out.\n            </p></div> <div class=\"columns is-marginless\"><div class=\"column p-l-0 p-r-0-mob\"><img src=\"/mpl-card.png\" alt=\"MPL\" class=\"wd-100 height-100\"></div> <div class=\"column\"><p class=\"text-justify p-b-10 p-b-0-tab\">\n                Life is learning. Period. Overcoming ignorance is the whole point of the journey.\n                You are not supposed to know at the beginning. The whole point of venturing into uncertainty\n                is to bring light to the darkness of our ignorance. I heard a great saying once: life is\n                like school, with one key difference, in school you get the lesson and then you take the test. But in\n                life, you get the test and it’s your job to take the lesson.\n                We are all waiting until we have deep knowledge wisdom and a sense of certainty\n                before we venture forth. But we have got it backwards; venturing forth is how\n                we gain the knowledge.\n              </p> <p class=\"text-justify is-hidden-tablet-only p-b-10\">\n                Over the next few years while our ignorance would rain down a deluge of pain and suffering,\n                when I look back, I see clearly it could have been no other way. As they say, everything\n                happens for a reason. The universe only teaches through experience. So even when you haven’t\n                the slightest clue what you are doing, you just have to take a deep breath and get on the bus.\n              </p></div></div> <div class=\"is-hidden-desktop is-hidden-mobile-only p-l-15 p-r-15 p-t-10\"><p class=\"text-justify\">\n              Over the next few years while our ignorance would rain down a deluge of pain and suffering,\n              when I look back, I see clearly it could have been no other way.

I was absolutely thrilled to begin my new adventure,\n              an adventure I had kept on hold because of the pandemic, as I was certain that\n              I wanted to experience it in person. A year passed but the situation didn’t, and\n              hence I jumped on this bus, no ordinary one, but one exploding escapade. We started\n              our journey with a theory course called “Mindful Personal Learning”. Intrigued from\n              the get go as not only was I starting my own individual journey, but I was also on an\n              online platform with 40 new individuals. Now like any other human we all start searching\n              for like-minded individuals, trying to make connections but our racing minds were immediately\n              stalled by a class where there would be NO JUDGEMENTS, lots of listening and a whole lot of\n              sharing!\n            </p> <p class=\"p-b-10\">\n              This course immediately stood out from the pack, as I now understood that in our chaotic\n              life some of our actions are a mirror to our past. It was time to stand at the balcony and\n              simply ponder. I quickly recognized that through fun intimate games that in this journey\n              called life, I was not alone! We were quickly put into ball games where we had to pour our\n              hearts out to people we have never met, people who we don’t know, people we called strangers\n              at that time. Our deep secrets, our thoughts about them, our feelings, our decisions based on\n              those feelings, our actions in past and the present, all these thoughts opened up like an\n              empty can of worms. But little did I know, it was easier than I anticipated. These hidden\n              emotions were all prevalent within each one of us. I quickly begin to make connections and\n              see how the past weighs us down and how who we are today plays a huge role in that.\n              The introspection and connections were inevitable.\n            </p> <p class=\"p-b-10\">\n              I did try to open up, slowly but surely. Through those intense conversations a strong felling\n              of gratitude emerged as well, something you tend to forget in the hustle bustle of real life.\n              I wondered if people listened, I wondered if my thoughts were ignored or looked at as small.\n              At times I wondered if the people I was talking to genuinely cared. I wondered if\n              I was actually ready to share even more. Millions of questions but only left as thoughts\n              as all we did was listen intently and were mindful of what we heard. It felt good to share\n              and felt this session progressed into far more than I ever thought. Our wounds needed to\n              breathe, needed some love and care, and needed a shoulder to cry on. I believe it was in\n              fact far more easier to share with the once called strangers as we knew we were not being\n              judged, or going to be called upon incidents from our past.\n            </p> <p class=\"p-b-10\">\n              Nonetheless, these lessons were heavy, they felt like boulders on our shoulders and\n              sometimes wished they didn’t happen but as class went on, we only got more secure with\n              ourselves and the like-minded individuals who were slowly turning into our friends. While\n              looking inward I came to terms with, that talking about dead lock situations could also heal\n              thoughts that are buried deep within. I looked at these sessions as cleaning of any those\n              clogged pipes I had within. I know I came out from them feeling more at ease with myself.\n              Acceptance finally crept in. I realized the importance of how sharing what’s within can make\n              you feel lighter.\n            </p> <div class=\"p-b-10\"><p class=\"p-b-10\">\n                As I write this I see the connection to these cases as something I can take back to my\n                own classrooms in the future. Some of my key takeaways from MPL have been as follows:\n              </p> <ul class=\"list-style\"><li>\n                  Let alone as a teacher, I will continue to learn to reflect and from time to time stand at\n                  the balcony trying to see the world from every angle. See my actions and make sure I reflect\n                  and not simply just respond to a situation.\n                </li> <li>\n                  I will continue not to judge any individual as you do not know where the person\n                  is coming from, what his family or surroundings are or what he has experienced\n                  in the past.\n                </li> <li>\n                  I will continue to share a listening ear to my students, just be there for them.\n                  You never know what is within them and what they want to share with you when, hopefully\n                  encouraging them to express themselves with ease.\n                </li> <li>\n                  Give the freedom of choice to the students of my class, realizing the responsibility\n                  of their own actions. Make them individual who are ready for the future and\n                  create their own journey.\n                </li> <li>\n                  Lastly I would like believe that one may not see it today or tomorrow but you will\n                  look back in a few years and be absolutely perplexed and awed by how every little\n                  thing added up and brought you somewhere wonderful or where you always wanted to be.\n                  You will be grateful things didn’t work out the way you once wanted them to. If you\n                  want to be happy, allow things to be – Osho\n                </li></ul></div></div></div></div></div></div>")])}
