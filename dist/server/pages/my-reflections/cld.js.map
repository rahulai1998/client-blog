I not only witnessed, but also got the chance to take a few\\n                classes independently and eventually even write a student profile based on my observations\\n                on one of them. The observation and the analysis occur so close together in your mind that\\n                they are practically indistinguishable. The gradual release of responsibility model\\n                displayed at IAAT left me spellbound. My collaborating teacher(CT) was a mentor to my\\n                lesson learnings. I learn not only how to conduct a class room with utmost dignity and\\n                poise but also learnt a whole deal of what kind of language is the most effective in a\\n                classroom.\\n              </p> <p class=\\\"text-justify is-hidden-tablet-only p-b-10\\\">\\n                She modeled every step of the way the way to orchestrate classes I was able to\\n                then take baby steps and share some of the teachings with her in class.\\n              </p></div></div> <div class=\\\"is-hidden-desktop is-hidden-mobile-only p-l-15 p-r-15 p-t-10\\\"><p class=\\\"text-justify\\\">\\n              She modeled every step of the way the way to orchestrate classes I was able to\\n              then take baby steps and share some of the teachings with her in class.\\n            </p></div> <div class=\\\"p-l-15 p-r-15 p-t-10\\\"><p class=\\\"text-justify\\\">\\n              She was always\\n              there to guide me and finally I was allowed to apply the mentoring and practise and make\\n              it a reality. I had the good fortune to then hear from my CT and my Teachor Educator(TE)\\n              and reflect on the notations not only did they share with me but also mine own on how to\\n              build upon my teaching skill set. The My key take away from the child observation are\\n              stated below in the form of the Gibbs Reflective cycle:\\n            </p></div> <div class=\\\"p-15\\\"><p class=\\\"text-justify dancing-font has-text-weight-semibold p-b-10 m-t-15\\\">\\n              Description: stage 1\\n            </p> <p class=\\\"text-justify p-b-10\\\">\\n              We were asked to observe and shadow a child in our practicing classrooms for a considerable\\n              period of time and use their work as an understanding into the learning of child development.\\n              Through this case study we got an insight into the interaction of language, socio-economic class,\\n              family background and schooling. We observed the student in different situations, made notes, informally\\n              had opportunities to speak to them about their family, interests, and hobbies and perceive the student\\n              as a learner. We were asked to gather and annotate observation records and work samples that\\n              characterized the child’s growth from the initial level to the current or most recent\\n              knowledge, skills, and behavior and throw light on the developmental progress these pieces\\n              of documentation demonstrate. The setting was in the online classroom with the class teachers\\n              and their peers as well. The outcome of the assignment was a beautiful end product of\\n              thoroughly understanding one child at length and seeing them from the many aspects that build\\n              their personality, i.e.: Physical presence and gestures, relationships with other\\n              children and adults (socio emotional development), their activities and interests, their ways\\n              of learning (cognitive development), what do their artifacts (notebooks, drawings, project\\n              work etc.) say about them, what are their likes and dislikes and would teaching them in those\\n              ways help them to learn further, an overall analysis and reflection and lastly write a report\\n              for the student in 2 course areas of their school.\\n            </p> <p class=\\\"text-justify dancing-font has-text-weight-semibold p-b-10 m-t-15\\\">\\n              Feelings: stage 2\\n            </p> <p class=\\\"text-justify p-b-10\\\">\\n              I was invested in this assignment and felt extremely attached to this child by the end of it.\\n              Initially I did feel apprehensive of how I would be able to make the connections with the\\n              theory taught in the class or even be able to infer the target set out for the task but\\n              every movement was recognized and looked at hoping I would have the opportunity to further\\n              analyze the child to receive information about their development. Before the assignment\\n              started I was concerned about not getting the opportunity to meet this child in person as\\n              well as the feeling of not getting enough time online with the child (distance learning)\\n              but one of the most daunting issues was to bring in more objectivity and less subjectivity.\\n              To maintain objectivity, it is important to record only what you have seen and/or heard,\\n              keeping all assumptions, interpretations, and opinions at bay. I believe I tried my hardest\\n              to spend as much time as I could and made the most of what I could understand of the child.\\n              After the assignment I still actually have withdrawal symptoms and till now when I am in\\n              class I am tempted to continue the analysis I had started a couple of months ago in spite\\n              of turning in my assignment.\\n            </p> <p class=\\\"text-justify p-b-10\\\">\\n              I was intrigued during the process and made a lot of anecdotal\\n              notes and small habits were noticed but it was only when I was organizing the information that\\n              I realized a lot of it wasn't necessary and one of the hardest parts was making the inferences\\n              based on the collective data I had, but once I started those, I could not help but read into a\\n              lot of things that were happening. I do believe I would be ready to observe more\\n              children from time to time and it is in fact a thorough inside in the overall\\n              development of the child.\\n            </p> <p class=\\\"text-justify dancing-font has-text-weight-semibold p-b-10 m-t-15\\\">\\n              Evaluation: stage 3\\n            </p> <p class=\\\"text-justify p-b-10\\\">\\n              This stage took me back to my anecdotal records and then having to edit them from time to\\n              time to see repetitions in her behavior, her words, her work etc. none the less this process\\n              was even better than I even expected it to be. It felt like a thorough project from the very\\n              start to the end. I struggled with making a note of every word she said and later having to\\n              edit that information and with the time, I had to be with her in class. I just wished I could\\n              get more of it to ask her more about her personal life. The student I observed was a child who\\n              was new to school but with out taking too much time fell right at home and embodied the school\\n              spirit in her stride. There were so many highs that I enjoyed, it was pure joy.\\n            </p> <p class=\\\"text-justify dancing-font has-text-weight-semibold p-b-10 m-t-15\\\">\\n              Analysis- Stage 4\\n            </p> <p class=\\\"text-justify p-b-10\\\">\\n              The project time was more than 3 months and I wondered why, it really does take that much\\n              time to make an analysis of anyone. I still believe the time was short and there is so much\\n              more to infer. Learning the stages of development in a child can be the lesson of ones dreams\\n              but seeing that in action and relating to concepts and understanding why certain behaviors\\n              occur is another. I believe the takes went off well and smoothly as I had the opportunity to\\n              observe a child who was from how she carried herself in class and because of her big\\n              personality. She was present, engaged and had so much to share. Things went well as I made\\n              sure to make a note of anything and everything I could see from the get go. I didn’t get\\n              enough time, I feel, even though I got a large understanding of it. I still think this\\n              situation was not so ideal as I didn’t get to meet her in person and I am sure I would see\\n              more of her personality then. I can make sense of this whole analysis, as I believe I got a\\n              thorough insight in the development of a child. Observation skills improve and develop over\\n              time. The more you observe the more behavioral patterns you can understand. Any change\\n              becomes evident and visible so that one can reflect and go back to what they have written\\n              earlier. By organizing and tracking their observations using the developmental domains,\\n              educators can ensure that they are gathering data from each of these domains, thus creating\\n              a sampling of observations that represents the whole child.\\n            </p> <p class=\\\"text-justify dancing-font has-text-weight-semibold p-b-10 m-t-15\\\">\\n              Reflection circle: Conclusion/action plans: stage 5 and 6\\n            </p> <p class=\\\"text-justify p-b-10\\\">\\n              Learning, reflecting and highlighting what changes to your actions could improve the outcome\\n              in the future is what I take away the most from this exercise. There was so much to unravel\\n              in a child and so much that makes them “THEM” too. So much that influences his teaching and\\n              his work ethics. I wish I had the chance to explore the child in the physical space.\\n              I believe the student was transparent and vulnerable even in the online world but I do\\n              know that children are very different in different situations. I think I would like to be\\n              more present and be there with my ears wide open to anything I could immediately put my mind\\n              to and see as a cue to learn further about the student. I could have may be even observed\\n              her in other classes that didn’t require me to be there like Hindi, art, music etc. to see\\n              her growth in those subjects as well as any connections that I could perhaps see.\\n              I think reading further and getting a thorough understanding of all the developmental\\n              aspects even at the beginning would then allow me to look for more signs that I could\\n              have used.\\n            </p> <p class=\\\"text-justify p-b-10\\\">\\n              I would love to be able to take observation to the next level by being able\\n              to look into more than one child and being able to carry this task eventually for\\n              my entire class. Good teachers are always observing their students—how they see the world,\\n              how they think, how they interact and how they learn. Knowing and caring about students as\\n              learners helps us teachers form relationships, decide what and how to teach, assess\\n              student understanding, and communicate with families about student progress. I do hope\\n              I get enough practice and opportunities in my life to do this.\\n            </p> <div class=\\\"text-justify p-b-10 m-t-15\\\"><p class=\\\"p-b-10\\\">\\n                Below is my role of being a teacher in the future:\\n              </p> <ul class=\\\"list-style\\\"><li>\\n                  To be intentional in the design of the environment in the classroom.
