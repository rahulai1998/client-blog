I didn’t know then but\n              looking back at my journey as a teenager, I now know that my best summers were spent\n              volunteering in camps helping children from NGOs (e.g. Akanksha, India) and small /\n              independent play-schools. This was it; I should have read into those signs back then.\n            </p> <p class=\"text-justify p-b-10\">\n              It is difficult to convey what working with children means to me in a brief cover letter,\n              but I shall attempt to do so while traversing my journey on how I get here.\n              I studied Psychology in college since I thought I had raw materials (e.g. being good listener,\n              reading people), which could help me make a career in this field in India. Abruptly,\n              I had to move to Dubai with my family in the midst of this phase. Here, I found myself doing\n              odd jobs as an administrator, an assistant to a GM and\n              even an assistant to the HR head. None of this gave me the inner-satisfaction I so\n              desperately seeked. So, I decided to pursue an MBA in Marketing, incorrectly assuming that I\n              would perhaps enjoy this and it could be a start of new career-path for me. Unfortunately, this\n              led me no-where too. Somewhere, in between all this, I volunteered at a center for children and\n              adults with Down syndrome (Karama, Dubai, U.A.E), which provided me with a spark.\n            </p> <p class=\"text-justify p-b-10\">\n              Thus my teaching odyssey began in 2006 (before which I was still mostly ignorant of purpose\n              of my life) when I started work as full-time fitness teacher at a gym specialized for kids.\n              Unsurprisingly, working with children again became a vast, multifaceted, shape shifting,\n              exhilarating subject that captured my attention. The love, admiration and respect I received\n              from the kids and my peers further fueled my longstanding passion of teaching kids. At this\n              point I was consumed by teaching kids; financially (my entire salary), intellectually (most\n              of my free time), and philosophically (I think I was materially contributing to the\n              betterment of the human condition).\n            </p></div> <div class=\"columns is-multiline p-t-10 p-l-20 p-r-20 p-b-30 p-r-10-mob p-l-10-mob\"><div class=\"column is-5-desktop is-12-tablet\"><div class=\"page-card is-green-color m-0\"><div class=\"has-text-centered p-b-30 p-l-10 p-r-10 p-t-30\"><img src=\"/resume.png\" alt=\"Deepika Godha Resume\" height=\"480\" width=\"350\" style=\"border: 1px solid white;border-radius: 3px;\"></div></div></div> <div class=\"column is-7-desktop is-12-tablet\"><div class=\"p-l-15 p-r-15 p-0-tab p-0-mob\"><p class=\"text-justify p-b-10\">\n                  The natural next step when I moved back to India was to take the plunge and start my\n                  own kids-gym. I took a break from this in 2014 when I became a mother to a beautiful\n                  daughter; check listing one of my age-old dreams! I was enjoying her childhood in the\n                  midst of other kids she attracted and hence I continued to be in touch with the “teacher”\n                  in me.\n                </p> <p class=\"text-justify p-b-10\">\n                  After a couple of years of volunteering at my daughter’s school and other NGOs, the\n                  school invited me to work full-time at their playschool. The four years pent here,\n                  continued to be a source of immense joy and pride for me.\n                </p> <p class=\"text-justify p-b-10\">\n                  Last year, I knew it was time to move on to sharpen my tools and get formally training\n                  in teaching kids since this is going to be a life-long endeavor for me. A lot of research\n                  led me to upon IAAT (I Am A Teacher), a course that has taught me many things but most\n                  importantly, also re-enforced the importance of the work of a teacher.\n                </p> <p class=\"text-justify p-b-10\">\n                  Coincidentally, my new family also decided to move to Dubai last year and life came a\n                  full circle when I took my job offer as a Learning-Assistant Teacher in the same British\n                  school that my daughter goes to!\n                </p> <p class=\"text-justify p-b-10\">\n                  Since the past year, I have been happily learning (IAAT) and teaching (at my daughter’s\n                  school) in Dubai while counting my blessings every day knowing the path I want to walk-on\n                  for rest of my life. I excitedly await to write the next chapter in my life and hope to\n                  continue being the gardener who\n                  can water the tiny plants each day and see them flourish in grow.\n                </p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>")])}
